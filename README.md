# AI_CNN

I designed a CNN model using TensorFlow that has been trained on a 
10,000 image dataset consisting of 10 classes. The CNN model had a fairly high accuracy 
when applied to the testing dataset. It was then compared to industry level CNN models like 
VGG16 trained on millions of images and having a much more comprehensive architecture.

The project briefing attached shows the goal of the project as a large image dataset is used to train and test a CNN model made from scratch using TensorFlow in Python so that is can be used for image classification tasks.

Note: The imageset is too large to attach into the file repository, but the Code attached shows the set of results that are produced through using the image dataset.

The final report which discusses the development of the project and the code is also provided. The CNN is created using Tensorflow, including a range of hyperparameter tuning such as number of epochs, type of optimizer, type of activation function, CNN architecture etc.
